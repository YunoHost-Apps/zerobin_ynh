PrivateBin is a minimalist, open source online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data.

Data is encrypted/decrypted in the browser using 256bit AES in Galois Counter mode.

This is a fork of ZeroBin, originally developed by SÃ©bastien Sauvage. It was refactored to allow easier and cleaner extensions and has now much more features than the original. It is however still fully compatible to the original ZeroBin 0.19 data storage scheme. Therefore such installations can be upgraded to this fork without loosing any data.
