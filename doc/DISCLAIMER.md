## Additional information

In the [update documentation](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration#zerobincompatibility) of PrivateBin, it is specified that:

For full compatibility with ZeroBin and to be able to decrypt old pastes, you would enable this option. However this is not recommend for new installations as it weakens the security of your PrivateBin instance.

This means that we have decided to delete the directory that allows us to save the data. You can save the 'data' directory, if you want to keep your data. But you should know that this weakens the security of this application.
